### Shell Utilities

This directory contains Bash scripts for advanced Linux/Unix system operations, mounting, and chroot management.

| Script            | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **chrootx**       | Safely mounts and chroots into disk images or directories. Handles `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, and loop devices automatically. |
| **mkmount**       | Creates temporary mountpoints safely under `/mnt/tmp` or `/run/mount`.                                                      |
| **umountsafe**    | Unmounts target directories with retry and dependency awareness (reads from `/proc/mounts`).                                |
| **loopinfo**      | Displays loop device information for mounted images.                                                                        |
| **is-mountpoint** | Checks if a directory is an active mountpoint.                                                                              |
| **mountdev**      | Mounts specific partitions from block devices interactively.                                                                |
| **bindmount**     | Creates bind mounts and automatically unmounts on exit.                                                                     |
